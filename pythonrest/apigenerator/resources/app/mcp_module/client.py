- Takes a Gemini API key and the path to the Swagger spec during initialization.
- Configures the `google.generativeai` library.
- Has an `ask_question` method that currently returns a placeholder response but outlines the steps involved.
- Includes basic error handling for the Gemini API interaction.
- Contains a `__main__` block for illustrative testing (which won't run as part of the Flask app).

The actual logic for parsing the Swagger spec and constructing sophisticated prompts for Gemini based on the spec and the question will need to be filled in by someone familiar with the original MCP server's capabilities.
