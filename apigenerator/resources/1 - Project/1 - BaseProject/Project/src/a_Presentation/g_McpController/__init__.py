# This file makes 'g_McpController' a Python package.
# It can also be used to define the Blueprint if preferred,
# or just to mark the directory as a package.

# Example of defining blueprint here (alternative to defining in AskController.py):
# from flask import Blueprint
# ask_bp = Blueprint('ask_bp', __name__, url_prefix='/mcp') # Define url_prefix here or during registration
# from . import AskController # Import routes after blueprint definition to avoid circular dependency
