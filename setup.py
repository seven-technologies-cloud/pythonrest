        "# PythonREST\n\n"
        "PythonREST is the ultimate full API generator for Python language. Based on the best performing frameworks "
        "and software development best practices, PythonREST can create an entire CRUD API in minutes or seconds "
        "based on your relational database on a single CLI command. This allows you to create your APIs from scratch "
        "and update your current API previously created with our tool to always match your latest database definitions.\n\n"
        "**THIS WILL SAVE YOU MONTHS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME, GUARANTEED!**\n\n"
        "Your new generated API will have full CRUD compatibility with your mapped database and full Swagger "
        "documentation and specs available. With your new API in hand, you will be able to containerize or serverless "
        "deploy it to any local, private, and public cloud providers of your choice and use it at will! If you're "
        "interested in taking your API to the next level and don't know how, please inquire with us at the email below "
        "for consultancy services.\n\n"
        "This project is under active enhancement, and we have several open GitHub issues to improve it further. "
        "If you're an Open Source enthusiast and wish to contribute, we'd be more than happy to have you on our team! "
        "Get in touch via [admin@seventechnologies.cloud](mailto:admin@seventechnologies.cloud) if you have any doubts "
        "or suggestions, and don't forget to star our repository!\n\n"
